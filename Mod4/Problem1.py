#1. Construct a truth table for the expression: (A AND B) OR (NOT B)
#where A and B each can be True or False.

#(A and B)   (not B)      (A and B) or (not b)
# A | A F       T           F           T   = T
# A | B T       F           T           F   = T
# B | A T       F           T           F   = T
# B | B F       F           F           F   = F
